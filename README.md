# Halpad
Halpad is a 9 key macropad with a knob and OLED designed around the idea of quickly selecting features.

## Features:
- Simplistic case design
- 128x32 OLED Display
- EC11 Rotary encoder
- 9 Switches

## CAD Model:
For the case, only M3x16mm and M3 heatset inserts are used for hardware, allowing for a simple BOM. It also only uses 3 3d printed parts for assembly, allowing for a quick and straightforward build.
